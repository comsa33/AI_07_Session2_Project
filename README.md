# [ML] YOUTUBE revenue prediction
youtube daily estimated revenue prediction with machine-learning (tree-based models)

## Introduction
> - Interest & Inspirations
> - Is it possible to predict a daily revenue of a certain youtuber with his/her channel's daily view, subscribers gained, average viewed duration, etc...?
> - Which factor is most related with increasing daily Revenue?
> - How much can Total Views of videos devote to actual Monetizing?
> - If one has more videos posted on his/her channel, would she/he happen to earn more?
